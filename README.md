## Before you start the program...
Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the program. We will be usign [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so we highly recommend to install the version that fits your device. Once you have downloaded Python and VS Code, download the .py file (Final_code 10-Dec-22.py) and the dataset called (Disco_df.xlsx)(.xlsx document) attached in the GitHub repository and make sure that you place all of the files in  the same directory in Visual Studio Code. 
For this, you should create a folder containing all the material previously mentioned. Then, in Visual Studio Code, you should click on: File -> Open Folder -> Select the folder you have created. With all this, you should be able to see the folder on the "Explorer" pannel from the left (Press Ctrl+B if you cannot see this pannel) 
Then you should open "Final_code 10-Dec-22.py" and see something like this:
